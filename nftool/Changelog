* nftools v. 2.0-rc4 (11.4.2007)
  - method @pmpdf/plot incorporated allowing to plot point-mass pdfs
  - small changes to the internal and public api of nfFunction and 
    nfSymfunction
     - new internal atribute of the function classes mappingDimension
       and new public property dimension
     - nfSymFunction has new public properties firstDerivatives and 
       secondDerivatives containing string representation of first
       and second partial derivatives
  - all function classes (iincluding those in examples) has implemented
    method nfsecpad for evaluation of second partial derivatives
  - the Second Order Filter is again part of the toolbox
  - modified api of the Gaussian Sum Filter (gsm) in order to be 
    unambiquous
  - it is possible to create the instance of gsm class without specifying
    the maximal number of filtering pdf mixture terms (i.e. the number
    of terms could grow unrestricted)
  
* nftools v. 2.0-rc3a (23.1.2007)
 - fixed problem with case sensitivity in MATLAB 6.5.x on Windows platform
 
* nftools v. 2.0-rc3 (21.1.2007)
 - corrected last minute bug in the nfdiff methods where the variable 
   numberOfVariables was not set
   
* nftools v. 2.0-rc2 (19.1.2007)
 - corrected severe bug in @nfSymFunction/nfdiff method resulting 
   dimension missmatch error
 - the rc1 contained wrong/outdated versions of the Particle filter.
   The class apf was removed and class pf was changed to propper version
 - incorporated rewritten Point mass filter
 - class @nfExampleFunction implemented different system that didn't 
   correspond to nfSymFunction('[x1^2*x2+w1;x2+w2]','','x1,x2','w1,w2')
 - corrected the @nfSymFunction/nfsecpad method for evaluating the second
   partial derivatives
 - the @estimator/estimate method uses waitbar to give user information
   about the progress of estimation process
   
* nftools v. 2.0-rc1 (15.12.2006)
 - first public release candidate
 - it is now possible to create user defined classes decribing
   multivariate functions as child classes of the nfFunction
   (removes the strong dependency on MATLAB Symbolic Toolbox)
 - new simulation method that make it possible to specify 
   pregenerated state and measurement noises
 - new filters: DD1, DD2 and UKF
 - Point Mass filter and Second order filter (they undergo rewrite)
